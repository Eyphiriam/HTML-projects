# README for HTML and JavaScript Calculator Project

This README document provides a comprehensive overview of the HTML and JavaScript-based Calculator project. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript to create a dynamic web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations and displays statistical data about the results.

## Project Overview

The Calculator project is designed to allow users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. It features a user-friendly interface for entering values and selecting operations, and it dynamically displays the results in a table format. Additionally, the project calculates and displays statistics such as the minimum, maximum, average, and total of all valid results.

## Features

- **Dynamic Calculation**: Users can input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation to compute results dynamically.
- **Result Table**: Displays each calculation with its operands, operator, and result in a structured table.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Provides a summary of calculations including minimum, maximum, average, and total values.
- **Error Handling**: Handles common input errors such as division by zero and invalid numeric entries.
- **Styling**: Styled with CSS for a clear and attractive user interface.

## HTML Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure and links to the JavaScript and CSS files.
- `JS Calculator.js`: The JavaScript file that contains all the logic for performing calculations, updating the DOM, and managing user interactions.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styling for the calculator, including layout and color schemes.

## Usage

### Running the Calculator

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter values for `X` and `Y`.
3. Select an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
4. Click a button to perform the calculation.
5. View the result in the result table below the input fields.
6. Continue with new calculations as desired. The table will update with each operation.
7. View the statistical summary in a separate table at the bottom of the page.

### Features

- **Input Fields**: Two input fields for entering numbers (`X` and `Y`).
- **Operation Selection**: Options to choose the arithmetic operation.
- **Calculate Button**: A button to execute the calculation.
- **Results Display**: A table that logs each operation along with its result.
- **Statistics Display**: A table that shows statistical data about all performed operations.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure.
- `JS Calculator.js`: JavaScript file that handles logic and DOM manipulation.
- `style.css`: Stylesheet for customizing the appearance.
